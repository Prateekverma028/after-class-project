            <code>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.</code><br>
            Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.<br>
            Sports commonly called football include association football<br>
            <kbd>known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand</kbd><br>
            Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football)<br>
            International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.These various forms of football share,<br>
            to varying degrees, common origins and are known as <mark>football codes</mark><br>

        <h4>-->Cricket</h4>
         <code>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot)<br>
            pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team,<br>
            the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler,<br>
            bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch.</code><br>
            The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges.<br>
            <kbd>Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.</kbd><br>
            The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are "out"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled<br>
            (when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit<br>
            by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket.<br>
            Cricket is one of many games in the <mark>club ball</mark> sphere that involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement.<br>
              <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England.</p>
